# Mechanical March in C

### ⚠️ Warning

In orther to not blow up this repo I removed the contents of the directory `test-framework` that lives inside of each exercise.
So to run the tests you'll need to download the files yourself and put it back into that directory.
The original file structure of `test-framework` was like this:
```text
test-framework/
    unity.c
    unity.h
    unity_internals.h
```
You can run these commands that will do it for you:
```bash
  # if this link is broken you can find more information about it here: throwtheswitch.org/unity
  wget https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/archive/master.zip
  unzip master.zip
  cp Unity-master/src/unity* exercise-that-you-want/test-framework/
```
